          <h2>A One-Day Global Community Event To Benefit Japan</h2>

          <p>"Shop For Japan" harnesses the power of business and the ubiquitous tools of social media to catalyze a global outpouring of support to benefit Japan’s recovery from the devastating earthquake and tsunami.</p>

          <h4>The concept is simple:</h4>

          <p>Participating businesses pledge to donate a percentage of their revenues from March 26th to one of Shop for Japan’s <partner charities>. These disaster relief charities are rigorously vetted and will all be participating in relief and reconstruction efforts in Japan. </p>

          <p>Consumers can access a directory and map of participating businesses at www.shopforjapan.com, where they can find more information about businesses near them, the percentage of their donation, and the charity that business is supporting.</p>

          <p>Most importantly, everyone is invited to participate by spreading the word, <downloading the participant kit>, printing posters, and encouraging businesses to get involved.  The tools we provide make it easy for participating businesses and their supporters to get the word out.</p>

          <p>The monies raised by the businesses are to be submitted directly to the partner charity of choice, reported on the business profile.  We will post a final tally at the end of the event so we can all celebrate!</p>

          <p>Please Visit and “Like” our Facebook Page, contribute photos to our Flickr Photopool, host a Shop for Japan party, and get the word out!</p>

          <p>We aim to show that with a little bit of creativity and the leverage of social media, we can all work together create a global movement to do good.</p>

          <p>Sound like fun?  Get involved!</p>

          <p>Brought to you by the Shop for Japan Team: Brooks Hassig, Kathryn Storm, Alex Grande, Edward West, Noel Vaughn, and Jacob Park.</p>
