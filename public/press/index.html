            <p>San Francisco, CA: "Shop For Japan" is harnessing the power of business and the ubiqui- tous tools of social media to catalyze a global outpouring of support to benefit Japan’s recovery from the devastating earthquake and tsunami.</p>
            <h4>The concept is simple:</h4>
            <p>Participating businesses pledge to donate a percentage of their revenues from March 26th to one of Shop for Japan’s recommended charities. These disaster relief charities are rigorously vetted and will all be participating in relief and reconstruction efforts in Japan.</p>
            <p>Consumers can access a directory and map of participating businesses at www.shopforjapan.com, where they can find more information about businesses near them, the percentage of their donation, and the charity that business is supporting.</p>
            <p>The website will also provide tools making it easy for participating businesses and their supporters to get the word out. These will include customizable posters that can be downloaded and printed, digital website banners, and social media-ready announcements that can be posted to Facebook and Twitter.</p>
            <p>The Shop For Japan Flickr and Facebook pages will enable participants to post photos associated with the event, and the Shop for Japan website will post a final tally of the funds raised.</p>
            <p>The project began as the brainchild of designer Brooks Hassig of Seeing Labs, a San Francisco based social media and branding firm, and Kathryn Storm. Brooks enlisted the help of his colleague, Alex Grande, also at Seeing Labs. The growing group brought in Edward West of Mission Motors, software engineer Noel Vaughn, and movement-builder Jacob Park to build a team that could create a global impact.</p>
            <p>"We wanted to create a really simple, easy way to do something for Japan that would create the maximum impact. Everyone who sees photos and videos of the devastation wants to get involved, and we wanted to build a platform to make that possible. Shop For Japan empowers businesses to join a movement that will allow them to support them- selves, the network of other businesses involved, and, most importantly, the people of Japan,” said Brooks Hassig.</p>
            <p>"I am consistently enthralled by the power of the internet to organize, connect, and create instant global community on a radically unprecedented scale. Shop For Japan is an exploration of the geometric scalability of communications, community organization, and an emerging network of businesses interested in doing well by doing good. The Shop For Japan project shows how much can be done, quickly, on a global scale, for nothing other than a modest investment of time and creativity," said Edward West.</p>
            <p>The Shop For Japan platform demonstrates a new paradigm of a decentralized network of businesses and consumers working together to do good, united only by an idea, without any official or formal affiliation.</p>
